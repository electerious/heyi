Update `CHANGELOG.md` with #changes that affect the user of the package.

Add a new `## [Unreleased]` section (or add to existing) with relevant subsections (`### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Removed`) listing changes as bullet points. Skip internal changes that don't impact users. Match existing entry formatting.

Only modify the changelog.
